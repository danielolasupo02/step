# React Form Step Movement

This is a simple React project that demonstrates step-by-step movement within a form using previous and next buttons. It's a useful pattern for breaking down a lengthy form into manageable sections, making it more user-friendly.

## Features

- Step-by-step form navigation.
- Validation and error handling for each step.
- Ability to move forward and backward through the form.
- Clear and user-friendly interface.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js and npm installed on your development machine.
- Basic knowledge of React and JavaScript.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/danielolasupo02/step.git
   ```

How it Works
The project is organized into components, each representing a step of the form. The state is managed using React's useState and useEffect hooks. The navigation buttons (Previous and Next) allow users to move between steps, and form validation is performed before proceeding to the next step.

The form data can be submitted upon completing all steps, or you can customize the behavior to meet your requirements.

## Customization

Feel free to customize this project to suit your needs. You can:

Add more form steps or remove existing ones.
Modify the validation logic.
Change the UI and styling to match your design preferences.
Integrate with a backend service to submit form data.
